        <div class="article-title">About the hash table data structure and its implementation in C++.</div>
        <div class="date">October 31, 2022</div>
        <div class="text">When handling large amounts of data, storing them in a list or an array is no longer a viable
            option. Finding or removing a given element takes more and more time. This is where hash tables come in: no
            matter the size of the data set, the time it takes to find or remove an element is constant. In this
            article, we will look at how hash tables work and go over an implementation in C++.</div>
        <div class="title">How do hash tables work?</div>
        <div class="text">A hash table is simply an array in which elements are added one after the other. However, they
            are not appened to the end of the array, but rather to a specific index, determined using the hash function.
        </div>
        <div class="text">An element of the hash table must have two fields: a key and a value. The key is fed to the
            hash function, which returns an index. The element is then stored in the array at this index. That way, when
            the user wants to find an element, he only has to provide the key, and will be able to retrieve the value in
            constant time.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Resolving collisions</div>
        <div class="text">All hash functions are deterministic, which means that for a given key, the hash function will
            always return the same index. However, it is possible that two different keys will return the same index.
            This is called a collision. This means that multiple elements can be stored at the same index. When this
            happens, the hash table must be able to handle it.</div>
        <div class="text">There are several ways to handle collisions. The one we will use here is called chaining. When
            a collision occurs, the element is stored in a linked list at the index of the collision. When the user
            searches for this element, the program will iterate through the linked list until it finds the element with
            the correct key. This admittedly takes more time than a simple array, but the lists are so short that it can
            still be considered constant time.</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="image_hash_table_summary.png">A summary of the hash table data structure.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Making the right choices</div>
        <div class="text">Multiple parameters can influence the performance of a hash table. First, the size of the
            array must be chosen wisely. If it is too small, collisions will occur more often, if it is too large,
            memory will be wasted and searching will take longer. The size of the array should also be a prime number,
            as this will reduce the number of collisions. To choose a good size, this formula can be used:</div>
            <div class="math">\[n \approx n_e \cdot 1.3\]
                \[n \text{ Table size, prime number}\]
                \[n_e \text{ Estimated number of elements}\]
            </div>
        <div class="text">The choice of the hash function is also important. Different hash functions will yield
            different results, and some will be better than others. They often use 'magical numbers' that were chosen by
            trial and error. Although I don't think changing them is worth the effort, they can still be parameters to
            play with.</div>
        <div class="title">My implementation in C++</div>
        <div class="subtitle">The objectives</div>
        <div class="text">I wanted to create a hash table that could be used in pretty much any project. I wanted it to
            be quick and easy to use, that is why I chose C++. I also wanted it to be able to handle any type of data,
            which implies the use of templates, and function overloading.</div>
        <div class="text">To demonstrate my project, I used the table to store data from NASA's JPL Small-Body Database.
            It contains over 1,250,000 solar system bodies, each one identified by a unique SPK-ID. I retrieved the data
            using the Query API, kept only the fields I was interested in, wrote them in a CSV file, then appened them
            in the hash table, using the SPK-IDs (integers) as keys.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">The Code</div>
        <div class="text">The code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/H3Aether/Hash-Table-Cpp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I will go over the most important parts here.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">The HashTableElement class</div>
        <div class="text">Before we can create the hash table, we need to create the elements that will be stored in it.
            The HashTableElement class is a template class that can store any type of data. It has two fields: a key of
            type K and a value of type V. It has different constructors to avoid throwing unwanted errors. It will be
            used to create subclasses, or directly for simple applications.</div>
            <pre><code class="hpp">
template &lt;class K, class V&gt;
class HashTableElement{
    public:
        HashTableElement(const K& k, const V& v) : key(k), value(v) {};
        HashTableElement(const K& k) : key(k), value() {};
        HashTableElement() : key(), value() {};
        ~HashTableElement() {};

        K getKey() const {return key;};
        V getValue() const {return value;};

    protected:
        K key;
        V value;
};
            </code></pre>
        <div class="subtitle">The HashFunction class</div>
        <div class="text">They table itself cannot be created with a proper hash function. This class contains all the
            different algorithms, as well as a method that will call the right one. It is based on an enum that contains
            all the different names of hash functions. The 'hash()' method, which is overloaded to handle any type of
            key, will call the right hash function based on the give enum value. The class also has an attribute that
            stores the size of the array, as it is used in every hash function.</div>
            <pre><code class="hpp">
enum HashFunctionType {POLYNOMIAL_ROLLING, DJB2, DIVISION, INTEGER_32};

class HashFunction{
    public:
        HashFunction(unsigned long int n, HashFunctionType hash_type) : table_size(n), type(hash_type) {};
        unsigned long int hash(const string& key) const;
        unsigned long int hash(const int& key) const;

        unsigned long int polynomialRolling(const string& key) const;
        unsigned long int djb2(const string& key) const;

        unsigned long int division(const int& key) const;
        unsigned long int integer32(const int& key) const;

    private:
        unsigned long int table_size;
        HashFunctionType type;
};
            </code></pre>
        <div class="subtitle">The HashTable class</div>
        <div class="text">Now we finally have everything we need. The HashTable class is also a template. Its attributes
            include the table itself, which is an array of lists, its size, its hash function, and some other values
            used for statistics. It has a constructor that takes the size of the array and the hash function as
            parameters. It has the usual methods to insert, search, and remove elements, as well as functions to print
            the table and its statistics.</div>
            <pre><code class="hpp">
template &lt;class T&gt;
class HashTable{
    public:
        HashTable(unsigned long int n, HashFunctionType hash_type);
        ~HashTable() {delete[] table;};

        void insert(const T& element);
        void find(T* element) const;
        void remove(const T& element);
        void printStatistics() const;
        void print() const;


    private:
        list&lt;T&gt;* table;
        size_t size;
        HashFunction hash_function;
        unsigned long int entries;
        unsigned long int empty_cells;
        unsigned long int collisions;
        bool isInTable(const T& element) const;
};
            </code></pre>
        <div class="subtitle">Handling errors</div>
        <div class="text">Some functions can fail for different reasons. In that case, they throw an exception. This
            makes the code easier to debug, as the user can catch the exception and print the error message. The classes
            are also templated, as they display the key of the element that lead to the error. Hence, the &lt;&lt;
            operator should be overloaded depending on the type of key used.</div>
        <div class="title">Results</div>
        <div class="text">I wrote a main function to demonstrate the program. It imports the data from the SBDB, and
            insert them one by one in the hash table. This operation takes some time, but once it is done the program
            runs smoothly. The statistics of the table are printed right after.</div>
        <div class="text">To search the database, the user enters the SPK-ID of an object. The result is displayed
            instantly. Some famous objects are: Oumuamua (SPK-ID 33788040), Ceres (SPK-ID 2000001), and
            67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (SPK-ID 1000012).</div>
