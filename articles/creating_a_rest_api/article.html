        <div class="article-title">Creating a REST API to get real-time data from the Euronext Paris stock exchange
        </div>
        <div class="date">November 14, 2022</div>
        <div class="text">I had the idea to create a web application that would allow me to easily visualise my stock
            wallet online. I started looking for a free API that would give me real-time or delayed information about
            the Euronext stock exchange. Sadly I couldnâ€™t find any free solution that would satisfy my needs (they were
            all heavily restricted or paid). So I decided to create my own. It will be useful if I ever want to create
            my
            web app.</div>
        <div class="title">The fonctionalities</div>
        <div class="text">This API has 3 roles. It has access to a database of all the companies listed on the Euronext
            Paris stock exchange. Based on that, it can provide information on any company when given either their name,
            symbol, or isin ID. Secondly, it can provide real-time information on the value of any stock, with
            additional data (opening price, highest and lowest price, vwap...). Finally it can access historical data,
            up to the creation of the stock.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">/company : Get information on a listed company</div>
        <div class="text">On the market, a company can be identified by its name, its symbol (often a shortened version
            of its name), or its unique isin ID. When given one, the API will return a JSON object containing the rest
            of them. The following examples return the same result:</div>
        <pre><code class="plaintext">
GET /company?symbol=STM
GET /company?name=STMICROELECTRONICS
GET /company?isin=NL0000226223
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="json">
{ "isin": "NL0000226223",
  "name": "STMICROELECTRONICS",
  "symbol": "STM",
  "market": "XPAR" }
        </code></pre>
        <div class="subtitle">/stock : Get real-time information on a stock</div>
        <div class="text">By specifying a company the same way as above, the API will return a JSON object containing
            the current value of the stock, as well as a lot of additional data.</div>
        <pre><code class="plaintext">
GET /stock?symbol=MC
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="json">
{ "company": {"isin": "FR0000121014", "name": "LVMH", "symbol": "MC", "market": "XPAR"},
 "price": 699.7,
 "currency": "EUR",
 "volume": {"value": 232350, "date": "14/11/2022 17:07"},
 "turnover": 163045303,

 "previous_close": {"price": 706.2, "date": "11/11/2022"},
 "52_week": [535.0, 758.5],
 "market_cap": "351.878B",
 "update_date": "14/11/2022 17:23 CET" }
        </code></pre>
        <div class="subtitle">/stock/chart : Get historical data on a stock</div>
        <div class="text">The API can also return historical data on a stock, namely the last values of the stock, the
            dates, and the volumes. A new parameter 'period' is added, and can take 2 value : 'intraday' (default) or
            'max'. The first one will return minute-by-minute data for the last 5 days, while the second one will return
            daily data for as long as the stock has been listed.</div>
        <pre><code class="plaintext">
GET /stock/chart?symbol=AIR (&period=intraday is implicit)
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="json">
[ { "time": "2022-11-07 17:35",
    "price": 113.98,
    "volume": 306095
  },
  { "time": "2022-11-08 09:00",
    "price": 113.36,
    "volume": 12964
  },
  ... ] 
        </code></pre>
        <div class="title">How it works</div>
        <div class="text">The API works by mimicking the requests made by the Euronext website. To do that, I navigated
            the website and used the developer tools to see what requests were made. I only kept the relevant ones and
            send them myself to the Euronext servers.</div>
        <div class="text">The app is built in Python using the Flask framework. I used the 'requests' library to send
            the requests to the Euronext servers, and the 'BeautifulSoup' library to parse the HTML responses. The
            companies are stored in a SQLite database.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Getting the list of companies from the website</div>
        <div class="text">To this day, there are 1,760 companies on the Eurnoext markets. I only want to reference
            companies that are on the Euronext Paris stock exchange, and tradable from Paris (430 in total). This is
            done via a POST request, by adding a JSON object that acts as a filter. The response is a list of HTML text,
            which is then parsed to extract the relevant information.</div>
        <pre><code class="python">
def get():
    with open(FILTER) as f:
        filter = json.load(f)
        r = requests.post(URL, data=filter)

    # The response is the list of all the stocks
    # Save the response to a file in utf-8 encoding
    response = r.json()
    response = format_stock_list(response)

    return response
        </code></pre>
        <div class="subtitle">The companies database</div>
        <div class="text">The list of companies can be subject to change, but this is very rare. Hence, to avoid
            fetching it every time the API is called, it is stored in a database. The database is created when the app
            is first launched, and updated every 24 hours. This speeds up the calls.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Getting historical information on a stock from the website</div>
        <div class="text">To fetch the historical prices of a stock, the API makes a GET request to the following URL:
        </div>
        <pre><code class="plaintext">
https://live.euronext.com/intraday_chart/getChartData/{isin}-{market}/{period}
        </code></pre>
        <div class="text">This call needs 3 arguments, the isin, the period, and the market on which the stock is listed
            (which for some reason is not always 'XPAR', but can be 'XBRU' or 'XAMS'). This is where the database is
            useful, as it contains the isin and the market for each company.</div>
        <div class="text">The response is a JSON object containing a list of dictionaries, each one containing the date,
            the value, and the volume of the stock. The API then returns the same object, which is already perfectly
            readable.</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Getting real-time information on a stock from the website</div>
        <div class="text">The most important data is the current value of the stock. To get it, the API uses the same
            method as above, but only keeps the last value.</div>
        <div class="text">The other detailed information is obtained by making a GET request to the following URL:</div>
        <pre><code class="plaintext">
https://live.euronext.com/en/intraday_chart/getDetailedQuoteAjax/{isin}-{market}/full
        </code></pre>
        <div class="text">The response is an HTML table, which is parsed to extract the relevant information. The API
            then returns a JSON object containing everything that was read.</div>
        <div class="title">Handling errors</div>
        <div class="text">In my API, requests can fail for multiple reasons. That is why errors are generated and
            brought to the user's attention. The following errors can occur :</div>
        <div class="text">- 400 : Bad request. The request is not formatted correctly.</div>
        <div class="text">- 404 : Not found. The company does not exist in the database.</div>
        <div class="text">- 502 : Bad gateway. The request to the Euronext servers failed for some reason.</div>
        <div class="text">Here is a diagram I made to guide my programming. It shows the different steps of the API, and
            the different errors that can occur:</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="image_diagram.png">The logic of the API</div>
        <div class="title">Conclusion</div>
        <div class="text">I am very happy with the result. The API is reliable, quite fast (considering it makes
            requests to other servers and not only to the local database), and easy to use. I will probably use it in
            the future to create my web app. I don't plan on deploying it yet, as it is not very useful for the moment.
            But if you want to use it, you can find the code on my <a
